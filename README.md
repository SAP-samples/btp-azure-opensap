### User Table

Throught this course we will create and use several users. Obviously you need to have a user for the SAP Cloud Platform. To create and register this user you need an Email address. This can be your company emails-Adress, but obviously also a private email adress. 

Next we will use Microsoft Azure. To create a free Azure subscription you need again an email adress. Here you can use again whatever email adress you like. However, throught the course we will use one dedicated email from Office 365 that we will assign to Azure. With this we want to make sure that we always seperate the different logins. 

This Office 365 subscription will also require a Microsoft account email (e.g. holger@outlook.com, max@hotmai.com). From there we will create a new user like holger@bruchelt.onmicrosoft.com, max@streifendeder.onmicrosoft.com)

So in summary we will have the following users:


|Service|Email-Template|Example|Description|
|----- |----| ---- | --- | 
|SAP Cloud Platform User|\<privateMeail>@\<yourprovider>.com|e.g. holger@outlook.com or holger@gmail.com|Personal Email-account This will be create in Week 2 Unit 2
SAP ES5 User|Pxxxxxx|e.g. P123123|This will be create in Week 2 Unit 3|
Office 365 User|\<youruser>@\<yourdomain>.onmicrosoft.com| e.g. holger@dev.onmicrosoft.com|This will be create in Week 1 Unit 5
Azure Portal|\<youruser>@\<yourdomain>.onmicrosoft.com|same as O365, ...|This will be create in Week 1 Unit 5
