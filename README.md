The hands-on exercises will continue to be available for some time. However, certain steps and screenshots may be out of date as products continue to evolve. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that all exercises will work as expected after the end of the course.

# Building applications on SAP BTP with Microsoft Services

Welcome! This repository serves as a central point for all exercises that are part of the openSAP course **Building applications on SAP BTP with Microsoft Services**. 

For all information about the course and the corresponding content please visit the [openSAP course page](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1). The exercises individually are only a small subset of the course and are not meant to be used on their own.  

Please do the exercises whenever they appear in the respective week pages in the openSAP course. 

### Accounts/Subscriptions needed in this course 

Throughout this course you will create and use several accounts. Obviously you need to have a private email address (outlook.com or alike) to register for these offerings. We do not recommend using your company email address for account registration, as this can lead to authorisation problems. (For example, if your company already has an Azure subscription).

The registration of the accounts is part of the exercises, so you do not need to have any accounts beforehand.

> **IMPORTANT: We recommend to perform all these setps in a Private-Window in your browser to make sure that you don't use your corporate or other already existing authentications.** 

So in summary you will create the following accounts:


| Service                           | Mail address                              | Link to the Unit                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SAP BTP Trial Account             | privatemail@outlook.com                   | [Week 1, Unit 2](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/tree/main/Week1/Unit2) |
| Azure Trial Account               | privatemail@outlook.com                   | [Week 1, Unit 3](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/tree/main/Week1/Unit3) |
| Microsoft365 Developer Account    | \<youruser>@\<yourdomain>.onmicrosoft.com | [Week 2, Unit 1](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/tree/main/Week2/Unit1) |
| SAP Conversational AI account     | privatemail@outlook.com                   | [Week 3, Unit 3](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/tree/main/Week3/Unit3) |  |
| SAP Analytics Cloud Trial account | privatemail@outlook.com                   | Week 4, Unit 1 - coming in Week 4                                                        |

Important: the Microsoft365 Developer account (\<youruser>@\<yourdomain>.onmicrosoft.com) needs to be added to the Azure Trial account. This is done in [Week2, Unit 1 (Step 1 - Step 4)]((https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-azure-opensap/tree/main/Week2/Unit1)). From then on, you will need \<youruser>@\<yourdomain>.onmicrosoft.com to sign in to Azure.
