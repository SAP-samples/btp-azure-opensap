This exercise is part of the openSAP course [Building applications on SAP Business Technology Platform with Microsoft services](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1) - there you will find more information and context. 

# Publish documents from SAP S/4HANA to SharePoint

The objective of this exercise is to get your hands "dirty" and develop the target scenario, using the development environment which you've set up in the last two units. You will configure your Open Connectors instance to communicate with your SharePoint instance, and integrate the Connector into your Integration Flow. The integration flow (which you will develop end-to-end in this unit), contains all the steps and logic required, to extract the PDF files from an S/4HANA system and send it to a SharePoint page using your Open Connectors instance.

Welcome to Unit 3 of Week 2. In the comprehensive exercise of this unit, you will build up an end-to-end scenario, which allows you to store billing documents from S/4HANA Cloud to your SharePoint team site. To achieve this scenario, you will make use of different SAP Integration Suite components like Cloud Integration and Open Connectors, as well as Microsoft tools like SharePoint and Azure.

## Step 1 - Configure Integration Suite Open Connectors

The Open Connectors component of the SAP Integration Suite, simplifies the connectivity to a lot of different resources like in this case **Microsoft SharePoint**. You will create a respective Open Connectors instance in this step, which will be used in the upcoming steps of this unit. So make sure your Connector is working properly before continuing with the next step. 

---

1.1 To create a connector for SharePoint within Open Connectors, go to your BTP Cockpit and open your **Integration Suite** application subscription. It will open in a new browser tab. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0105.png)

1.2 You should now see your capabilities in the **Integration Suite Launchpad**. Select **Extend Non-SAP Connectivity** to open the Open Connectors application. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0110.png)


1.3 In case you are required to login again, use your **sap.com** credentials. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0130.png)


1.4 You will be redirected to the **Open Connectors** Home page.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0140.png)


1.5 Within Open Connectors, click on the **Connectors tab** to view all the available pre-built connectors. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0150.png)


1.6 Search for the SharePoint connector by typing **SharePoint** in the search region (top right). Hover over the SharePoint connector and select the option Authenticate to connect to your own SharePoint account.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0160.png)


1.7 In the connection wizard: 

* enter a name for your connector instance like **SharePointApp**
* enter your SharePoint address in the format {your_sharepoint_domain}.sharepoint.com
* enter your copied Application (client) ID from the Azure app registration in the API Key text field, 
* enter your copied secret from the Azure app registration in the API Secret text field and select **Show Optional Fields**. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0170.png)

1.8 During the creation of the client & Secret in the Azure App registration, you selected the **Delegated user access** approached. Therefore, the **Delegate User** flag has to be set to **true** in Open Connectors as well.

1.9 Select **Create Instance** to create SharePoint connector instance.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0180.png)

> You may be prompted to enter your Microsoft subscription user credentials. In case, you are already logged into your SharePoint the logged in session may be automatically taken by the browser. 
> **IMPORTANT:** In any case, make sure you are logged in with your Microsoft365 Developer account. 

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0183.png)

> You may be prompted to trust the SharePoint OAuth application. Select **Trust It**

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0187.png)


1.10 After the authenticated connection to your Microsoft account has been created successfully, you will be able to test out the connection from SAP BTP Open Connectors. To try out the SharePoint connector APIs, click on the option **Test in the API Docs**.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0190.png)


1.11 This will launch the integrated OpenAPI specification based on the API documentation for your SharePoint connector, so that you can test and try out the connector from SAP BTP Open Connectors.

Select the available resource **GET /files** to read files from your SharePoint.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0200.png)


1.12 To read files from SharePoint, the information about your teams site has to be provided in the field Subsite in the format **/sites/{your_site_name}** and the path to your file has to be passed in the format **/{your_directory}/{your_filename}**. 

In our example, the name of the SharePoint teams site used was **General** and name of the filename was **docx**. Enter **/welcome.docx** in the path field and **/sites/General** in the Subsite field. 

1.13 Select **Execute**.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0210.png)


1.14 Your API request should return with a Code **200**. If not, check if the Subsite and the path are provided correctly! Click on the **Download file** link, to download and view your file from SharePoint.

1.15 In the **Curl** subsection, please copy the values in the Authorization header, like you can see in the screenshot. Note down these values, as you will need them later, when calling the API from SAP BTP Cloud Integration.

![Open Connectors](./images/ioc_0220.png)


**Congratulations! With this step, you have successfully created a SharePoint connector instance from Open Connectors capability of SAP Integration Suite. You will be able to use this connector instance in Cloud Integration to integrate data from SAP system to SharePoint or build an application connecting to your SharePoint account.**


## Step 2 - Check out SAP API Business Hub and fetch API Key

The SAP API Business Hub is the central catalog of all SAP and partner APIs for developers to build sample apps, extensions and open integrations with SAP. In this tutorial, [Billing Document â€“ Read, Cancel, GetPDF](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BILLING_DOCUMENT_SRV/resource) from SAP S/4HANA Cloud APIs has been used.

---

2.1 To discover and explore SAP S/4HANA Cloud APIs navigate to [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com).


2.2 Select "Login" on the top right of the screen, to be able to retrieve your personal API Key.

2.5 Go to APIs, ODATA V2, search for **GetPdf** and select the **Billing Document - Read, Cancel, GetPDF** API. 

![API Business Hub](./images/sah_0040.png)


2.6 In the Overview tab of the respective API, click on **Try Out**.

![API Business Hub](./images/sah_0050.png)


2.7 For this integration scenario, a service operation named GetPDF will be used. Select the GET request for **GetPdf** on the left side of the screen. 

2.8 This API endpoint returns the billing document information in a PDF format. The document identifier needs to be passed as query parameter named BillingDoument in the format **BillingDocument= 'document_id'**.  

2.9 Enter '90002930' (including the single quotes) into the **BillingDocument** field. Click on **Execute** to test your request. 

![API Business Hub](./images/sah_0060.png)


2.10 Your request should return with a **200** return code. To make use of the sample API within your Cloud Integration flow, you need to retrieve your API key. Therefor, click on **Show API key** on the top right of your screen.

![API Business Hub](./images/sah_0070.png)


2.11 Select **Copy Key and Close** to copy this API Key. This API Key will be used from Cloud Integration to get the billing document.

![API Business Hub](./images/sah_0080.png)


**Congratulations! You've learned how to navigate within and how to use the SAP API Business Hub in this step and you obtained an API key. This can be used in the following steps to call the S/4HANA Cloud Sandbox API provided by the API Business Hub.**


## Step 3 - Create your SharePoint Integration Flow

In this comprehensive step, you will create an Integration Flow within SAP Cloud Integration. This Integration Flow will be responsible for extracting the S/4HANA PDF files and sending it to SharePoint via your Open Connectors instance. It contains a major part of your extension logic and gives you a first impression of the advanced features provided by the Integration Suite. As SAP Cloud Integration is a very powerful tool with a lot of features and configuration options, make sure you read all instructions carefully before development. This prevents you from missing any detail, which might cause you analysis effort in the end.

* Address :- https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BILLING_DOCUMENT_SRV/GetPDF
* Query :- BillingDocument=%27${property.doc_id}%27
* Method :- GET
* Authentication :- None
* Request Headers : *
* Response Headers : *

> In the query parameter you can notice that property doc_id is referenced dynamically as ${property.doc_id}. Since the apikey is passed via the message header set in the Initialize S4HC Value integration step the authentication type is selected to None.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0380.png)


3.24 Extend the size of your **Integration Process** area by moving the **End** button over the edge of the box.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0400.png)


3.25 The **GetPDF service operation** of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud ODataAPI, returns the PDF document in the base64 encoded format. Add a Filter step to read this file content with XPath expression.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0410.png)

3.42 Select and connect the **Initialize SP Values** and **Post File to SharePoint** integration steps.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0650.png)


3.44 Add a receiver from the Participants integration palette and place it below the **Post File to SharePoint** integration step. Alternatively, you can also take the existing receiver from your canvas and place it below the respective integration step.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0660.png)


3.45 Change the name of the added **Receiver** step to **SharePoint** to improve readability.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0680.png)


3.46 Select and connect the **Post File to SharePoint** Request Reply step to the recently placed **Receiver**. 

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0690.png)


3.47 This will open the Adapter list, where you need to select HTTP from the available adapters.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0700.png)


3.48 Under the Connection tab, enter details as follows.
* Address :- ```https://api.openconnectors.trial.<BTP Trial Region e.g. ap21>.ext.hana.ondemand.com/elements/api-v2/files```
* Query :- size=${property.byteSize}&path=%2Fbilling_${property.doc_id}.pdf&overwrite=true
* Method :- POST
* Authentication :- None
* Request Headers : *


>In the query parameters, you can notice the usage of the property.byteSize field. The property **byteSize** is set in the Groovy Script step. To dynamically set the document id, you can notice the usage of the property.doc_id field. The property doc_id is set in the **Initialize SP Values** integration step. The overwrite query parameter is set to true, to override existing files in SharePoint. Setting it to false, would ensure that files are not overwritten and may result in a **429 file already exists** error.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0710.png)


3.49 Select and connect the **Post File to SharePoint** to the **End message** to complete the integration process flow.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0720.png)


3.50 Select **Save** and then click the **Deploy** button to deploy this integration flow to SAP BTP Integration tenant.

>Note, the first-time deployment might take some time before the changes are fully deployed.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0790.png)

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0800.png)


3.53 Select **Monitor Message Processing**  to view the successfully executed integration flow. 

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0810.png)


3.54 Since the integration flow was designed as a Run immediate timer-based integration, the flow will be executed as soon as it deployed. If status is **Completed**, then the billing document read from SAP S/4HANA Cloud system was posted to your SharePoint team site.

![Cloud Integration](./images/cif_0920.png)


**Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your first Integration Flow, which will be used to store billing documents coming from S/4HANA Cloud, in your SharePoint team site. In the next step, you will check if the document was successfully uploaded to Share Point, to validate if your Integration Flow is working properly.**


## Step 4 - Review result in SharePoint

In this step, you will check whether your PDF file has been successfully uploaded to your SharePoint page. 

---

4.1 Go to your SharePoint site once again and check if the PDF billing document is available. 

![Cloud Integration](./images/res_0010.png)


4.2 Open the billing document and check if the PDF document can be opened as desired. 

![Cloud Integration](./images/res_0020.png)


**Congratulations! Your Integration Flow is working properly and has successfully uploaded the billing document to SharePoint.**
