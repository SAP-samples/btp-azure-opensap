Extend productivity beyond SAP ecosystem using MS Teams and Outlook as engagement channels for workflows

Sample project where an employee can create a leave request via chatbot from Microsoft Teams integrated with SAP Conversational AI which triggers an SAP Workflow. The manager of the employee can approve or reject the leave request via a My Inbox app or directly from Microsoft Outlook inbox via Microsoft actionable messages. As soon as the request is approved, a calendar entry will be created in the employee’s Microsoft Outlook triggered via Microsoft Graph APIs
