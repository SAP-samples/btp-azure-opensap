Even though the course is now closed, you can still access the videos and PDFs in self-paced mode via the openSAP course itself. The hands-on exercises will continue to be available for some time. However, certain steps and screenshots may be out of date as products continue to evolve. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that all exercises will work as expected after the end of the course.
