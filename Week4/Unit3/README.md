## Step 1 - Create Azure Virtual Machine

As we want to federate data that resides at Azure Data Explorer (ADX), we want to deploy the Data Provisioning Agent (DPAgent) as close as possible to the source data. Therefore we will be using AzureÂ´s Virtual Machine service to deploy a Suse Linux Enterprise virtual machine (VM), where the DPAgent will run.

---

1.1 Navigate to <https://portal.azure.com> and log in with your Azure Account. 

1.2 Search for **Virtual Machines** and select the corresponding entry from the result list. 

![Search for Azure VMs](./images/azurevm_search.png)

1.3 Create a new Azure VM via **Create** a new Azure VM. 

![Search for Azure VMs](./images/add_azurevm.png)

1.4 In the basic configuration screen set the following configuration:
* **Subscription:** Azure Trial subscription that you have setup in [Week 1, Unit3](../../Week1/Unit3/README.md)
* **Resource Group:** penSAPWeek4-RG (created in the previous unit)
* **Virtual machine name:** DPAVM
* **Region**: Same region as your Azure Data Explorer (previous unit) is located in
* **Availability Options**: No infrastructure redundancy required (*not recommended for production*)
* **Image**: SUSE Enterprise Linux image (e.g. SUSE Enterprise Linux 15 SP2 +Patching - Gen2)
* **Size**: Standard_B4ms - 4 vcpus, 16 GiB memory (**IMPORTANT:** You need to click on **See all sizes to be able to select this machine)
* **Authentication Type**: SSH public key
* **Username**: azureuser (*keep the default value for this purpose, not recommended for production*)
* **SSH public key source**: Generate new key pair
* **Key pair name**: DPAVM_key

1.8 For the **security group** we are creating a custom one and add the public IP from the machine we are working from. Click on **create new**.

> **Note:** For the virtual network, the subnet and the public IP we are sticking to the defaults.
![New Security Group](./images/new_securitygroup.png)

1.9 Keep everything as it is and continue with **OK**. 
![New Security Group Details](./images/securitygroup_details.png)

1.10 Proceed to **Review + create**. 
![Review + Create button for VM](./images/securitygroup_details.png)

1.11 Go on and **Create** the Azure VM. 
![Review + Create button for VM](./images/create_vm.png)

1.12 A prompt comes up. Make sure to **download the key pair** that will be required to log on to the VM via SSH.
![Download SSH key](./images/download_key.png)

You should then see a conformation that the virtual machine was succesfully created. 
![Download SSH key](./images/vmdeploy_finished.png)


---

**IMPORTANT:** <a name="restartvm">Stop & Start your Virtual Machine when you don't need it. The Virtual Machine is otherwise unnecessarily consuming some of your free credits (in case you are using the Azure Free Trial subscription). </a>

Search for your Virtual Machine in the Azure Portal: 

![Search VM via Portal](./images/portal_search_vm.png)

**Start** or **Stop** the VM depending on your needs. 

![Search VM via Portal](./images/start_stop_vm.png)

Step 2.6 will show you how to log on to your VM again. **Every time the Virtual Machine is started again, it will have a new public IP address!**

---

## Step 2 - Prepare Azure Virtual Machine

Before we can actually install the Data Provisioning Agent on the Virtual Machine, a few things like directories and users need to be created. 

---

2.1 **WINDOWS USER ONLY: If you are using Windows, please make sure that you SSH & SCP installed. Therefore open a command prompt and execute the following commands:**

```shell
ssh
```

```shell
scp
```

![Search for command prompt](./images/command_prompt_search.png)

![Verification of SSH and SCP tool installed](./images/ssh_scp_verification.png)

In case you are getting errors like *'not recognized as an internal or external command'*, please install the tools. Verify the installation again using the commands above after you have installed the mentioned tools. Installation links: 

* SCP: <https://winscp.net/eng/docs/installation>
* SSH: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse>

> macOS users have these tools installed by default. 

2.2 In case you don't have a terminal (macOS)/command prompt (Windows) open, please open one now. 

2.3 Navigate to the location of your key file that you have downloaded in step 1.12 using the **cd** command. 

Windows: 

![Find downloaded certificate file on macOS](./images/windows_dir.png)

> **dir** lists the directory content on Windows, **ls** lists the directory content on macOS. 

macOS: 

![Find downloaded certificate file on macOS](./images/macos_dir.png)

2.4 Go to the Azure Portal (<https://portal.azure.com>) and search for your VM and select it from the result list. 

![Find downloaded certificate file on macOS](./images/search_vm.png)

2.5 Copy the **public IP address**.

![Public IP address in the VM overview](./images/public_ip.png)

2.6 Execute the following command to connect to your Azure VM: 

Windows: 
```shell
ssh -i <.cer file name> azureuser@<public ip address>
```

![SSH connection on Windows](./images/ssh_connect_win.png)

macOS: 
```shell
chmod 400 <.cer file name> && ssh -i <.cer file name> azureuser@<public ip address>
```

![SSH connection on Windows](./images/ssh_connect_mac.png)

> **Note:** Answer 'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? with **yes**.

One you see **Have a lot of fun** in the output, you are succesfully connected to your Virtual Machine. 

2.7 Next up, as we do not want to use the **azureuser**, who has root rights, to install and run the DP Agent we will create a user specific for the DPAgent activities. Therefore, execute the following command to create a new user: 

```shell
sudo useradd -m dpa-user
```

> This command doesn't depend on your actual operation system anymore since you are connected to the VM that runs SUSE Enterprise Linux. 

![Create new user using sudo](./images/useradd_dpa.png)

2.8 The new user requires a password, to set one run: 

```shell
sudo passwd dpa-user
```

![Change password of new user](./images/passwd_change.png)

2.9 Now we need to create the installation folder and provide our new user with the respective rights to install software in that directory. First, change into the **/usr** directory:

```shell
cd /usr
```

2.10 Create a directory called **sap**: 

```shell 
sudo mkdir sap
```

2.11 Change into the new directory: 

```shell
cd sap 
```

![Create SAP directory](./images/create_sapdir.png)

2.12 Create another folder inside /usr/sap called **dataprovagent** running:

```shell
sudo mkdir dataprovagent
```

2.13 Change the ownership of this new folder to our dpa-user using: 

```shell
sudo chown dpa-user:users dataprovagent
```

![Create and adjust new DPAgent directory](./images/dataprovagent_dir.png)

## Step 3 - Install Data Provisioning Agent (DPAgent)

Since the Virtual Machine is succesfully created and prepared, you can now start to install the Data Provisiong Agent on the Virtual Machine. 

--- 


3.1 As a first step download **SDI Data Provisioning Agent for Linux** from <https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloudintegration> to your local machine. (You need to scroll down on this page)

> **IMPORTANT:** Please make sure you are downloading the SDI Data Provisioning Agent for Linux, since the Virtual Machine runs on Linux!

![Download DPAgent](./images/download_dpa.png)

3.2 After the download is completed we send it from our local machine to the VM on Azure using the secure copy command. Therefore, open a **new terminal/command prompt** (to keep the existing ssh session alive) and execute the following command. 

```shell
scp -i <.cer file name> <downloaded DPAgent file> azureuser@<public ip address>:/tmp/
```

> The <.cer file name> and  <public ip address> were already used in Step 2.6. The same values should be used here. 
> The <downloaded DPAgent file> is the file that you have downloaded in Step 3.1. Make sure that you are using the right path to the file in this command. 

Windows: 
![SCP Transfer Windows](./images/scp_transfer_windows.png)

macOS: 
![SCP Transfer Windows](./images/scp_transfer_macOS.png)

3.3 After successfully copying the installer, switch back to the terminal/command prompt, where you are logged in to the VM and switch the user to the **dpa-user** by running: 

```shell
su - dpa-user
```
![Switch to DPA User](./images/switch_user.png)

3.4 Navigate into the **tmp** directory, where you have copied the installer (Step 3.2) into by running: 

```shell
cd /tmp
```

![Switch to DPA User](./images/switch_tmp.png)

3.5 As the installer is a ZIP file, **unzip** it by running:

```shell
unzip <DPAgent ZIP File>
```

> Note: double check if the DPAgent installer file was succesfully copied using the **ls** command to lis the directories content. 

![Unzip DPAgent Installer](./images/unzip_installer.png)

3.6 Navigate into the extracted folder: 

```shell
cd <unzipped directory name>
```

> Again, you can use **ls** to find out the exact directory name and use your **tab** key while using **cd** to autocomplete the directory name. 

![Switch into extracted DPAgent Installer directory](./images/switch_to_installerdir.png)

3.7 Finally, run the installer: 

```shell
./hdbinst --silent --batch --path="/usr/sap/dataprovagent/"
```
![Start DPAgent installer](./images/start_installer.png)

The Data Provsioning Agent has now been succesfully installed!

## Step 4 - Configure DPAgent - JDBC Driver 

Now that the installation has been finished, the DPAgent is ready to be configured and to be connected. In order to connect to Azure Data Explorer, the DPAgent is using the *MssqlLogReaderAdapter* - therfore, you need the Microsoft JDBC driver.

--- 

4.1 Download the driver **version 8.4** [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/sql/connect/jdbc/release-notes-for-the-jdbc-driver?view=sql-server-ver15#84) to your local machine. 

![Start DPAgent installer](./images/download-jdbc.png)

4.2 Again, you need to send this JDBC Driver from your local machine to the VM running the following command in the terminal/command prompt **where you are NOT logged on with the dpa-user**:

```shell
scp -i <.cer file name> <jdbc file name> azureuser@<public ip address>:/tmp/
``` 

Windows:
![Copy JDBC driver on Windows](./images/copy_jdbc_win.png)

macOS:
![Copy JDBC driver on macOS](./images/copy_jdbc_mac.png)

4.3 Go back to the **terminal/command prompt where you are logged on with the dpa-user** and navigate to the **/tmp** directory: 

```shell
cd /tmp
```
![Go to the tmp directory](./images/jdbc_tmp_folder.png)

4.4 Unzip the JDBC Driver ZIP file into the the **lib** directory of the DPAgent:

```bash
unzip sqljdbc_8.4.1.0_enu.zip -d /usr/sap/dataprovagent/lib
```

![Unzip into /usr/sap/dataprovagent/lib directory ](./images/unzip_into_dir.png)


## Step 5 - Double-Check SAP HANA Cloud Status

<a name="hanacloudstatus">Since the SAP HANA Cloud instance in SAP BTP Trial is automatically stopped after a certain time, make sure that your SAP HANA Cloud instance is running. This is needed since you are going to establish a connection between the SAP HANA Cloud instance and the Data Provisioning Agent in the next step. </a>

---

5.1 Go to the SAP BTP Trial Cockpit <https://hanatrial.ondemand.com> and navigate to your **hanacloud** subaccount where you have set up the SAP HANA Cloud instance in [Week 4, Unit1](../Unit1/README.md).

![Navigate to SAP HANA Cloud subaccount](./images/hanacloud_subaccount.png)

5.2 Open the **dev** space. 

![Navigate to SAP HANA Cloud subaccount, dev space](./images/open_devspace.png)

5.3 Navigate to the **SAP HANA Cloud** menu item. 

![Navigate to SAP HANA Cloud menu](./images/hana_cloud_menu.png)

5.4 Open the context menu of your SAP HANA Cloud instance using the **actions** button and select **Open in SAP HANA Cloud Central**. Sign in with your SAP BTP Trial account. 

![open SAP HANA Cloud instance in HANA Cloud Central](./images/open_hanacloudcentral.png)

5.5 In case your SAP HANA Cloud instance is **Stopped**, select **...** to open the available actions for this SAP HANA Cloud instance. **Start** the instance.

> Starting the instance can take a few minutes. 

![Start HANA Cloud instance](./images/open_hanacloudcentral.png)

5.6 Refresh the page every now and then to get the current status of the SAP HANA Cloud instance. 

![Start HANA Cloud instance](./images/refresh_instancen_status.png)

> Wait until SAP HANA Cloud instance is in status **Running**

## Step 6 - Start DPAgent

6.1 In the terminal/command prompt, where you are logged in with the **dpa-user**, navigate into the **bin** directory of the DPAgent: 

```shell
cd /usr/sap/dataprovagent/bin
```

> In case you are not logged in anymore, please revisit Step 2.6 to log in. Make sure that you have the right public IP address (Step 2.4 & Step 2.5). 
> **IMPORTANT:** Use the **dpa-user** for this operations. ```su - dpa-user``` is the right command to switch to the **dpa-user**. 

![List binary directory of DPAgent](./images/list_bindirectory.png)

6.2 Start the DPAgent Configuration tool: 

```shell
./agentcli.sh --configAgent
```

![Start DPAgent config tool](./images/start_dpatool.png)
