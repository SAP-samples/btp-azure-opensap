This exercise is part of the openSAP course [Building applications on SAP Business Technology Platform with Microsoft services](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1) - there you will find more information and context. 

# Unit-Titel

Describe in a nutshell what the functional aspsect of this unit is in 3-4 words. Remember: Users may have no idea what they are going to do or what services they'll use. It's potentially their first time touching the service at all. This will also be the teaser text for the exercise page on openSAP. Additionally, tell them what they need to have to finish the exercise. (services/tools)

Example: 
TODO Link to Haruts exercise

## Problems
> If you have any issues with the exercises, don't hesitate to open a question in the openSAP Discussion forum for this course. Provide the exact step number: "Week3Unit1, Step 1.1: Command cannot be executed. My expected result was [...], my actual result was [...]". Logs, etc. are always highly appreciated.

## Step 1 - Here's a sub-scenario title (e.g. "Setting up BTP Trial")

Split up the scenario in consumable bits & pieces before you cut them into single executable steps. Describe in a nutshell what's the purpose of this section. Then, write down the single steps and highlight the buttons/links where they should click on so they can easily find where to go. If possible, provide as many as screenshots as possible and highlight the important area with a red rectangle. 

(Don't be intimidated of taking screenshots because they can be oudated - the course content will be outdated relatively soon and the effort to maintain everything is anyway impossible)

**Remember:** Users DO(!) struggle with particular steps in this exercises. Make it easy for them to tell in the openSAP forum where they might be stuck. Do not combine multiple steps in a single step otherwise the explanation of the users may look like: "hey, the reply of the command in step1.1 for the third click is ...". compared to: "Hey, step1.1 doesn't work".

Example: 
*Good work!
You successfully finished the setup and configuration of all necessary services and tools which is required for the Week 3 and you will use them in later Unites.*
